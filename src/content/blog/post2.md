## Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is widely used in automation, data analysis, and web development.

## OOP
OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. However, when we are using Python, there might be some differences compared to other languages like Java or C#.

### Classes
The first thing we need to understand is the concept of classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the object will have.

Check the [dog.py](https://github.com/JoanEsquivel/python-poo-patterns/blob/master/introduction/basics/dog.py) file to see the example of a class.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class, known as a child or subclass, is created based on an existing class, called a parent or superclass. The child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

The video will be **available soon**.
