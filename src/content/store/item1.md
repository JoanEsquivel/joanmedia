## Cypress overview & feature highlight:

Cypress comes with a beautiful test runner that is going to help you as a QA Engineer to debug your test scripts, travel back in time to see what happened during the execution, and is perfect to change between your scripts with a friendly UI.

But also, you do not need the test runner, you only need to run command to run a full suite and get an HTML report.

Cypress is changing fast, and part of my objetive is bring to my students the newest features, and good practices to the course.
